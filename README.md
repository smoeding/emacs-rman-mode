# Emacs major mode to write Oracle RMAN scripts

I wrote this code to have a simple major mode to code my RMAN scripts.

## Features

- Font lock
- Simple indentation

## Installation

Copy the file `rman-mode.el` to a directory in your `load-path`. Optionally byte compile the file. Add the following code to your Emacs startup file:


```elisp
(autoload 'rman-mode "rman-mode" "Major mode for RMAN files" t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.rman\\'" . rman-mode))
```

This will enable `rman-mode` for files using the `.rman` file extension.
